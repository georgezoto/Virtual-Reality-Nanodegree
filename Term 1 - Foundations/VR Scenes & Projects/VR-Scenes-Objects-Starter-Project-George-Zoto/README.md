# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0
- Submitting for Android

How long it took to complete the project:
This project was heavily based on the lecture notes so a good understanding of the notes plus the project took me about 2 weeks.

One thing you liked about the project:
I really like that I can bring something unique to life.

One thing that was particularly challenging about the project:
Where do I start... There are several topics that make this project and nanodegree
in general challenging:
1) Brand new UI and terminology
2) Answers given in Discussion forums many times forget that students are still
beginners at this field and they use terms introduced later in the class to explain something in the beginning of it.
3) Lack of many terms ever properly explained in the class or in the forums, for example GVR and how is it used or dual and single cameras for VR deployment.
4) Limited ability of a mentor to help out just by messaging given that most of the issues are inside Unity's UI,
perhaps a screen sharing feature would be more useful for this degree.
5) Simple terms take a long time to understand and explain eg: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/animation-trigger-in-this-project/195659
6) Lack of explanation of Hardware configuration and requirements especially for the next Terms.
7) Better organized class in general, here are some suggestions from my activity: https://discussions.udacity.com/u/georgezoto/activity
