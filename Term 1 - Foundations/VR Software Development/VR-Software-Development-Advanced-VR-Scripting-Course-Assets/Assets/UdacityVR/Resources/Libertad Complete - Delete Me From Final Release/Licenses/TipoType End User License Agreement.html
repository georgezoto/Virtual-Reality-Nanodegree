<p>Why is important font licensing?</p>
<p>Advantages:<br>
TipoType, like many others, is a very-very small type foundry that produces high quality typefaces. Designing typefaces is a very hard process and it takes a long time to develope a font that could be used properly. It&#8217;s also an act of love and passion. In those terms, licensing is an act of respect. And, most important, the guarantee that type designers can continue creating original new faces.</p>
